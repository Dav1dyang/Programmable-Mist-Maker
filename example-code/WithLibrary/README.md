## ðŸ“¦ Library Installation

### ðŸ”— Option 1: Install via Arduino IDE using GitHub URL

1. In Arduino IDE, go to:  
   `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`

2. Paste this URL into your browser and download the ZIP file:  
   [Download Library ZIP](https://github.com/owochel/MistMaker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

3. Select the downloaded ZIP file in Arduino IDE.

4. You're done! Now you can access example code via:  
   `File > Examples > MistMaker > SimpleControl`
   or
   `File > Examples > MistMaker > Blink`

### ðŸ’» Option 2: Clone or Copy into Libraries Folder (Advanced)

Clone this subfolder manually and place it inside your Arduino libraries directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owochel/MistMaker.git
cp -r MistMaker ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/
```

Note: Your library location may be different. [Look at Arduino Support Article here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415103213714-Find-sketches-libraries-board-cores-and-other-files-on-your-computer) to see how you can locate your Libary folder.
